The model can be found in maomao.dae. 3d model of a a cat.

Extra credit tasks:

eraseVertex() 
splitPolygon() - for triangulate
bevelVertex() - When we click on the vertex in bevel mode, we create a new face at the middle point of each edge by default. Holding the mouse and drag left/right to decrease/increase the size of the bevel face.
bevelFace() - When we click on the face in bevel mode, we create a new face at the middle point of each edge by default. Holding the mouse and drag left/right to decrease/increase the size of the bevel face and drag up/down to increase/decrease the height (distance on the normal vector).
